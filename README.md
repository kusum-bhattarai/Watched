# Movie Library App 

A React-based movie library app that lets users explore movies, view details, and save their favoritesâ€”all without requiring authentication. The app fetches data from the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) and persists saved movies locally for a seamless experience.

## Features
- Search and browse movies, including popular and trending titles.
- Add movies/series under custom categories with personalized ratings and descriptions so that you can always remember how you felt when you watched the movie/series.
- View detailed movie information, including ratings, descriptions, and streaming providers.
- Persistent storage using `localStorage` for user convenience.
